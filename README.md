# Address Book in C
This project is a simple Address Book implemented in C. It allows users to store, search, modify, and delete contact information. The Address Book can handle multiple entries and includes features like:

- Adding new contacts (name, phone number, address, etc.)
- Searching for contacts
- Editing existing contact details
- Deleting contacts
- Displaying all saved contacts

The project demonstrates basic file handling in C, as all contact details are saved in a file for persistence.
